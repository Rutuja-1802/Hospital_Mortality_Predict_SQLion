Healthcare professionals aim to identify key causes of in-hospital mortality to enable early interventions and evidence-based protocols that can reduce preventable deaths.

🔍 Approach
Cleaned and prepared the dataset in Excel, then imported into MySQL for querying.

Used SQL to analyze patient attributes: age, gender, BMI, heart rate, ICU stay, and comorbidities.

Visualized insights using an interactive Tableau dashboard.

📊 Key Insights
Out of 10,000 admitted patients, 634 (6.34%) died.

Age was a major factor—patients aged 70-89 had the highest mortality.

Comorbidities like diabetes, immunosuppression, and solid tumors showed elevated death rates.

Patients who died had an average heart rate of 115.1 bpm and a normal BMI of 23.3.

ICU stays longer than a day were linked to significantly higher mortality.

✅ Conclusion
Age, comorbidities, and heart rate were strong predictors of mortality. Notably, nearly 1 in 5 patients aged 70+ died. Diabetes had the highest mortality among comorbidities, highlighting the importance of chronic disease management during hospitalization.

🔄 Recommendations
The dataset lacked variables like treatments, medications, other vitals, and socioeconomic or psychosocial factors. Including these in future analyses would offer a more complete view of in-hospital mortality and improve care strategies.
